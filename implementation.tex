\subsection{DOM Engine}

KHTML/WebKit (KDE, Apple), JavaScriptCore or V8 (Google);
The Gecko engine (Mozilla Corporation) and it's JavaScript implementation Spidermonkey;
We briefly checked on Presto (Opera) and Trident (Microsoft), but discarded them due to their proprietary nature.

\subsubsection{Firefox AddOn}

To avoid interference with other AddOns and existing configuration, we suggest creating a new browser profile for use with the AddOn.
For easy use, Firefox' proxy configuration is automatically pointed to a preconfigured host and the user is directed to a special landing page upon successful installation.

\subsection{Storage and Control}

database and web server. 

\subsubsection{Web Server}

small Python CGI scripts;
provides per-corpora submission list,
controls serving of random corpus pages;
tutorial mode: visual diff after submit;
ssl connections only;

	Here, the annotation from \ref{f:tut0} was wrong in tagging the sub-heading ``ITSS Helpdesk'': the correct annotation (\textit{yellow}) is highlighted in the feedback.}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Database}

Raw HTML in sqlite3;
user submissions are anonymized, but trackable by id;

\subsubsection{Proxy}

\subsection{Feature Extractors}

app produces input files for pipelines, dumped in the filesystem, per-page with one line per dom text node;
integrated dom feature extraction;
integrated screen grab;

\subsubsection{Text}

Dumped raw text, leading and trailing whitespace removed, UTF-8.

\subsubsection{Meta Visual}

Use data from living DOM Tree in XUL App.

\subsubsection{Visual}

Screenshot and use JAMF as seen in \cite{Steger08}
\footnote{This Extractor requires at least XULRunner Version 1.9.2 (corresponding to Firefox Version 3.5) which is still in beta at the time of this writing}

\subsection{Machine Learner}

Generic input vectors and classes from extractors
