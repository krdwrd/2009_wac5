WaC-5 Paper and Presentation: Architecture for Unified Processing of Web Content

    abstract = {Algorithmic processing of Web content mostly works on textual
        contents, neglecting visual information. Annotation tools largely share
        this deficit as well. We specify requirements for an architecture to
        overcome both problems and propose an implementation, the KrdWrd
        system. It uses the Gecko rendering engine for both annotation and
        feature extraction, providing unified data access in every processing
        step. Stable data storage and collaboration control scripts for group
        annotations of massive corpora are provided via a Web interface coupled
        with a HTTP proxy. A modular interface allows for linguistic and visual
        data feature extractor plugins. The implementation is suitable for many
        tasks in theWeb as corpus domain and beyond.},
