Working with algorithms that rely on user-annotated web content suffer from two major deficits:


For annotators, the presentation of web sites in the context of annotation tools usually does not match their everyday web experience.
The lack or degeneration of non-textual context may negatively affect the annotators' performance
and the learning requirements of special annotation tools may make it harder to find and motivate annotators in the first place.


Feature extraction on annotated web pages leaves much of the information encoded in the page unused,
mainly those concerned with rendering.


In this paper, we present the design (\ref{design}) and implementation (\ref{impl}) of the {\KrdWrd} architecture that adresses these two issues.
Section \ref{casestudy} demonstrates a show-case in the context of the CleanEval challenge and Section \ref{conc} concludes with an outlook on possible applications and implementation improvements.
